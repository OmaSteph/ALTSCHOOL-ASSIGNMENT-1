    <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
    <p>My name is Ogunwa Chioma Stephanie. I am 25 years old and a graduate of Electronic and Computer Engineering from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria and have lived my entire life in Lagos excluding the six years I spent in the University. Professionally, I am a tutor and educator. I have been teaching for over 10 years and specialize in Mathematics, Physics and Further Mathematics. I started tutoring at a very young age, straight out of Secondary School and I've loved every bit of it. I am very passionate about helping others get past whatever academic struggle they are having. As far as hobbies go, I enjoy reading, watching movies, listening to good music, cooking, baking and researching. </p>

    <h4>WHY I JOINED THE ALTSCHOOL PROGRAM</h4>
    <p>I started my tech journey in 2017. I made a backend engineering friend in that year and fell in love with how he worked. He introduced me to Frontend ENgineering and I started learning about HTML. My first excuse was that I didnt have a laptop. I worked and saved up enough to get one early 2018 and was able to write some Hello World paragraphs. I got in school and told myself I was too busy to focus on anything else. I have been on and off since then and have not made any significant progress in all those years. I kept making excuses when really I was being lazy and scared. Scared of failure. Failure is something I have never experienced before so I was scared of trying something new because I wasn't sure if I'll actually be good at it. I have taken a ton of free courses but I never see any of them through. When I came across ALTSCHOOL, something in me got so excited. No more silly excuses. I have a laptop in good eniugh condition, I am now a graduate and do not need to worry about school, the course is not free and I believ that would keep me in line. But above all, I really want to do this. I want to become an outstanding Software Engineer. Someone valuable enough to leave footprints in the world. </p>

    <h5>MY GOALS FOR THE SCHOOOL OF ENGINEERING PROGRAM</h5>
    <p>I have just one goal and that is to come out of this program come November 2025 as a very skillful FrontEnd Engineer. </p>
